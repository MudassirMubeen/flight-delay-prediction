# ✈ Flight Delay Prediction using Aviation Data Model

This project uses an aviation dataset to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a flight will be delayed or on time based on features like airline, origin/destination airport, day of the week, and time of departure.

## Dataset
The dataset contains over **530,000** flight records with features:
- Airline
- Flight Number
- Airport From
- Airport To
- Day of the Week
- Scheduled Time
- Delay Status (Target)

## ML Model
We used:
- Data preprocessing and feature encoding
- Train-test split
- Algorithms like Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and XGBoost
- Performance evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall
